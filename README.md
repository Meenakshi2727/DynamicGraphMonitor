This project focuses on developing a graph-based network model for real-time monitoring and analysis. It incorporates efficient pathfinding and optimization algorithms to enhance network performance. A dynamic Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is constructed to optimize data communication and event detection. The system also integrates network fault management to ensure robustness. Additionally, dynamic network update modules allow adaptability to changing conditions. The project includes visualization tools for network insights and real-time data analysis and prediction capabilities
