# THIS IS OUR PROJECT ENTITLED " FOREST FIRE PREDICTION WITH SENSOR NETWORKS "
# OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS PRIMARILY TO FIND THE SHORTEST PATH FROM THE SENSOR OF FIRE SOURCE TO THE DESTINATION (SERVER).
# WE HAVE OTHER SPECIFICATIONS LIKE PATH FAILURE, NODE FAILURE , ADD SENSOR ETC..

#############   THIS PROJECT IS DEVELOPED FOR UNDIRECTED GRAPH   ########################

SO WHILE GIVING INPUTS FOR CREATING A GRAPH FROM SCRATCH AS SOURCE, DESTINATION, WEIGHT:
            SAY a,b,C
            MAKE SURE TO GIVE AS b,a,C too 
            SO THIS ITSELF WILL BE CONSIDERED AS 2 DIFFERENT EDGES
